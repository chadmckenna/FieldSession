VILLAGES

Villages is a social bookkeeping application, designed to streamline the process of finding temporary caregivers for one's children.  While many parents could hire a babysitter, they instead opt for neigborhood networks that accomplish much the same.  The drawbacks of the system is that it is hard to maintain a "balance" of who did what and how much it was worth.

Villages changes all of that.

Villages is a credit-based system that takes all the legwork of booking dates and managing a balance and frees parents up to take the time they need.

Villages is a web-based app written in Ruby on Rails.

Version 1.0 was completed in the summer of 2011 by Colorado School of Mines CS field session group #RK.  Upon completion and submission to the client, this field session group and all of its members individually relinquish responsibility and culpability for the code.  This application is submitted "As is," and client has acknowledged that more work needs to be done completed before it will be ready for production.
