  %h3 Statement of Rights and Responsibilities

  %p
    This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement") derives from the Villages Principles, and governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Villages. By using or accessing Villages, you agree to this Statement.
    %ol
      %li Safety

      %p
        We do our best to keep Villages safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to do that, which includes the following commitments: 
        %ol 
          %li Villages is not trying to reinvent the basic premise of a babysitting co-op or micromanage the process.  Therefore there will always be an element of trust and integrity of both parties which is why it is so important for everyone to be very conscience of who they accept as neighbors.  All caregivers from each household in which you agree to be part of your village will be able to have access to all of your household information, including, but not limited to your children’s names, birthdates, address, and phone numbers.  Only invite and accept into your village those households in which you trust with this information.
          %li Those individuals who have signed up for Villages service and are associated with a household may search for Neighbors but will only be provided your household name, caregivers names,  city,  state and picture (if provided by you).
  
      %li Registration and Account Security
  
      %p 
        Villages users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account: 
        %ol
          %li You will not provide any false personal information on Villages, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.

          %li You will not use Villages if you are a convicted sex offender.
          %li You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date.

          %li You will not transfer your account (including any page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission.
          %li If you select a username for your account we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).

        We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.

        %ol
          %li You can use your privacy settings to limit how your name and profile picture may be associated with commercial, sponsored, or related content (such as a brand you like) served or enhanced by us.
